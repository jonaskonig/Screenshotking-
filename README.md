# Screenshotking - Makes Your life easy

 You have a Slideshow in pptx or ppsx and they are full of animations? 
 And you want to Print it out but all these animations and thinks layover each other?
 Then that simple python program will save you the day.
 All you have to do is download that little program, install all the missing packages with the shell.sh or bat.bat
 or via
 ```
pip install fpdf pyautogui pillow pynput PySimpleGUI
```
## Mac OS
So to run the program without any issues, it's best to give Python (the Programming language) access to everything.
For that you have to hob into your Settings --> Security --> privacy and search for full disk access
There you open the lock in the lower-left corner and click in the +-Symbol
Now you have to know where Python is on your Mac. Normally it's in 
```
/usr/bin/python3
```
But in order to get there, you have first to press ```Command+Shift+Dot(.) ```
Then you have to go to  ``` WhateveryourMacisnamed MacBook --> Macintosh HD --> usr --> bin --> python3 ```
And add it. 
Now it should work just fine if not go to the same Folder and search for python (without 3) and add that as well

And then run the screenshotter.py
